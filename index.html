            <p>
                On April 20, 1999, a high school shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado led to the deaths of 13 people. Twelve students and one teacher were killed by students Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris.

            <p>
                Years afterwards, the impact of the Columbine High School shooting is remembered by many. A poem written by Christine Deaton describes the thoughts that others have had over the event.

                They have fallen without permission, their final journey not 
                their say.
                <br>
                Their gruesome end without compassion, no one should die that 
                way.
                <br><br>
                Most go to school to learn and listen, but some just don't heed 
                the words.
                <br>
                They feel self pity and oppression, they live by rules of the 
                absurd.
                <br><br>
                A ticking bomb inside their minds, a fuse lit by nothing,
                <br>
                to self fulfill a fantasy easing rage and hollow trustings.
                <br><br>
                But innocents have fallen never knowing why, who can ease the 
                pain
                <br>
                of those left behind watching a senseless, violent game.
                <br><br>
                And before this madness ever ends, how many will there be,
                <br>
                who'll taste the target of other's self-righteous anarchy.
                <br><br>
                A troubled mind we cannot see, sometimes we can only guess,
                <br>
                but those who are close should undoubtedly see some signs of 
                their unrest. 
                <br><br>
                A child is a child, they come with unsteady minds
                <br>
                and there are some that consistently walk a fine, unstable line.
                <br><br>
                They need the balance they've never had, but whose job is it 
                anyway?!
                <br>
                In a throwaway society, who has the final say?!
                <br><br>
                The truth is that the Fallen are not just those who've died, 
                <br>
                but those who are the perpetrators and those who never tried.
                <br><br>
                The Fallen are a melting pot of hopelessness an despair
                <br>
                and there may not be an end in sight unless we all become aware.
                <br><br>
                Our children are our future, but will our future say,
                <br>
                if we allow this destruction to carry on this way.
                <br><br>
                Don't turn away from the desperation in the calling.
                <br>
                There are enough casualties, the casualties of the Fallen.
