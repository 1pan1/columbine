            <h2>The Story</h2>
            <p>
                On April 20, 1999, a high school shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado led to the deaths of 13 people. Twelve students and one teacher were killed by students Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris. 
                <br><br>
                The attack began at approximately 11:19 AM. Dylan and Eric opened fire in Columbine High SChool, killing 13 and wounding 23 others before committing suicide. In the next few years, people would believe the reason for the shooting was to take revenge on the bullies that made their lives miserable. But now, the story unfolds, as more evidence is released and FBI investigators share their conclusions. Dylan and Eric were not simply planning a school shooting, they had been planning on outdoing the Oklahoma City bombing of 1995. The shooting had been planned for April 19, the anniversary of the bombing. Columbine had been planned as a massive bombing, only their lack of bombmaking skills prevented a more devastating attack. There had been several propane bombs setup in the cafeteria, enough to wipe out 600 people. The survivors would be gunned down by Dylan and Eric. Then their cars would have exploded, killing even more. They were preparing for an attack that would go down in history as an infamous mass murder bombing, not as a school shooting (Cullen).
                <br><br>
                The killers were two very different people, in both personality and motives. Dylan Klebold was hotheaded, but depressed and suicidal, blaming himself for his problems (Cullen). Anxious and lovelorn, he summed up his life as "the most miserable existance in the history of time" in his journal.
                Eric Harris, on the other hand, was what psycologists now say, a cold-blooded, predatory psychopath, and a smart, charming liar (Toppo). Harris was the one who devised the attack. A high school senior, Harris got good grades in school, but at home wrote of killing thousands in his journal. According to then principal Frank DeAngelis, "Harris was the type of kid who, when he was in front of adults, he'd tell you what you wanted to hear."

            <h2>The Impact</h2>
            <p>
                Years afterwards, the impact of the Columbine High School shooting is remembered by many. A poem written by Christine Deaton describes the thoughts that others have had over the event.

                They have fallen without permission, their final journey not 
                their say.
                <br>
                Their gruesome end without compassion, no one should die that 
                way.
                <br><br>
                Most go to school to learn and listen, but some just don't heed 
                the words.
                <br>
                They feel self pity and oppression, they live by rules of the 
                absurd.
                <br><br>
                A ticking bomb inside their minds, a fuse lit by nothing,
                <br>
                to self fulfill a fantasy easing rage and hollow trustings.
                <br><br>
                But innocents have fallen never knowing why, who can ease the 
                pain
                <br>
                of those left behind watching a senseless, violent game.
                <br><br>
                And before this madness ever ends, how many will there be,
                <br>
                who'll taste the target of other's self-righteous anarchy.
                <br><br>
                A troubled mind we cannot see, sometimes we can only guess,
                <br>
                but those who are close should undoubtedly see some signs of 
                their unrest. 
                <br><br>
                A child is a child, they come with unsteady minds
                <br>
                and there are some that consistently walk a fine, unstable line.
                <br><br>
                They need the balance they've never had, but whose job is it 
                anyway?!
                <br>
                In a throwaway society, who has the final say?!
                <br><br>
                The truth is that the Fallen are not just those who've died, 
                <br>
                but those who are the perpetrators and those who never tried.
                <br><br>
                The Fallen are a melting pot of hopelessness an despair
                <br>
                and there may not be an end in sight unless we all become aware.
                <br><br>
                Our children are our future, but will our future say,
                <br>
                if we allow this destruction to carry on this way.
                <br><br>
                Don't turn away from the desperation in the calling.
                <br>
                There are enough casualties, the casualties of the Fallen.

                Today, people all around the country remember that day, and what it meant for them. Parents especially began worrying, including my dad, "When I heard about the shootings, I was worried, but with what the school has been doing, I can relax a little." Teachers were also among those who felt the shock of what had occured. Johnston Middle School ELP teacher Kathy Paul remmbers how she felt, "I heard about it from colleagues but did not have access to a news feed until I got home. I recall feeling numb with disbelief, as this episode was unheard of at the time." Even though there had been school shootings before Columbine, none had been as significant. Schools had been on guard, but Columbine really got schools moving. According to then principal Frank DeAngelis, "Columbine served as a wake-up call. No one can ever say, 'It could never happen here.'"
                <br><br>
                Tribute to those who died was expressed in many ways, including through music. A song by Sarah McLachlan published on April 20, 1999, included audio clips taken from the news broadcasts four years earlier.

            <h2>The Future</h2>
            <p>
                In the future, things will change. In schools all around the country, saftey measures are being increased. At Lucy Addison Middle School in Roanoke, VA., art teacher Benjamin Addison stands at the door, watching the students as they walk past. He looks for "the little things" and looks for signs of anger, grief, unhappiniess, or aggression (Elias).
                <br><br>
                Columbine kick-started a school safety movement nationwide. Schools began locking doors, installing security cameras, and requiring staff and visitors to wear ID badges.
                <br><br>
                Johnston has implemented these saftey precautions as well, many of the changes happening last year and this year. Rhys South, an engineering teacher at JHS, believes that "Some of the new changes make sense, others not so much. Nubmering entrance doors plainly, employee ID badges, and locking entrances during the day makes sense. Locking doors in the school all the time and spending hours of staff time going over and over procedures for a shooting that whill never hpapen, does not." South makes a point that some of these security precations are not going to help when it comes to a student shooting, "Much of the security focus has been on adult "stranger" intruders which accounts for only a couple of school shootings in US history. Most shooters are students."
                <br><br>
                Others are looking for more than what is already in place. Mitch Gearhart, a teacher at JHS, wants restritions on guns, "I think gun laws should be changed. I believe semi-automatic guns should be outlawed for all citizens, and only be used for Police and Military use. I am an avid hunter who owns 8 guns. None of the guns I own are semi-automatic."
